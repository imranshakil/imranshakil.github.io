The purpose of this project is to introduce a new platform that facilitates the optimization of energy usage for electrical appliances of a home or office with the use of a number of integrated IoT devices to ensure an interactive, user-friendly, and intelligent operation for viewing and controlling the power consumption of the home or office. The proposed platform includes a number of room with various sensors connected close to the equipment loads which will detect and transfer the data to a room energy management open source software that allows sensing and control of AC loads at a small or a medium-sized home or commercial building. Finally, the purpose would be to extract the energy consumption data from the energy meter and transfer it onto a database that will show the user how much of the energy is being consumed throughout the process. Afterward, the user can improve energy efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and foster demand response implementation of power utilities. \\nPossible challenges during the implementation of the hardware will be as follows. Firstly, the collection of input from multiple loads using less number of sensors and lastly, the collection of data from an energy meter and entering these data into the database for monitoring and controlling purposes. The first challenge can be solved by the use of a set of sensors to detect input from a number of loads and then, sending the signal onto a Raspberry Pi which detects and transfers the data onto the database for monitoring and controlling of these loads. Load controlling will use a relay connected to Raspberry Pi that can control the 220V loads using 5V only. After we obtain the algorithm for an energy meter, we will use it onto our software for the collection of the data onto our database. Thus, the user can get all the data sources that could allow him to effectively control the energy usage of the room appliances.\\nFurther study is required for the development of this project because with the development of energy meters throughout the years, the algorithms might change and the collection procedure might vary. Therefore, we need a competent way to collect the data from any energy meter available. In the initial phase the proposed system will work without the use of smart appliance. However, in the future, we shall be using smart appliances to a much greater extent to make our system more efficient.\\nIn conclusion, we will design and develop a smart system to upgrade our energy usage of electrical appliances in our everyday lives that not only saves energy but also allows us to smartly operate our home or office and will also reduce energy costs.","tech_stack":["Python","Django","ChartJs","CSS","Bootstrap","JSON","API","Raspberry PI","Energy Measurement Meter(PZEM-004t)","Sensors"],"duration":"1 Year","role":"Thesis Researcher","additional":""},{"name":"Automated Garden Watering System","platform":"IoT & Electronics","cover_img":"img/portfolio/iot/app02/01.png","project_link":"https://github.com/imranshakil","short_intro":"An IoT-based automated garden watering system using Arduino and sensors to manage water flow for plants.
